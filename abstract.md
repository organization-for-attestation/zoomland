# Introduction

**Abstract:** This chapter outlines the conceptual framework of the book and the variety of viewpoints related to the use of the notion of scale and zooming in digital history and humanities. The contributions included in the volume encompass different degrees of theoretical assumptions, practical insights and middle-ground reflections, symbolically expressed through the three conceptual levels: *birdâ€™s-eye view, overhead view* and *ground view*. While no general theory of scale is defined, the reader is offered the ingredients needed to build such theoretical constructs based on his or her own exploratory and symbolic journey through Zoomland. This variable-scale representation is combined with four categories of enquiry or thematic realms that make up the territory of Zoomland: *History, Media, Hermeneutics* and *Digital landscapes*.

**Keywords:** scale, zooming, digital history, digital humanities, multiple perspective
